# Unicorn.io

### What it does
This project is created during Treehacks 2018 at Stanford University. It aims to address the
pain points for job seekers to find startup companies that do not have postings on the popular
job posting websites such as Indeed or Glassdoor. Unicorn.io scrapes company data from
[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) and evaluates the companies, then find the most suitable
matches for you.

Upload your resume to unicorn.io, select a couple parameters for companies, then see the
next unicorn tailored just for you!
